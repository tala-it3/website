    <h4 class="p-4">What is Phishing?</h4>

    <p>Phishing is a form of fraud in which hackers try to gain sensitive information such as passwords or bank account details, typically done through email while attempting to appear as if originating from trusted sources. The goal is to manipulate victims into disclosing personal information or unknowingly install malicious software.</p>
    <p>The attacker uses the stolen information to further target the victim or impersonate the victim to cause further data theft and exploitation. The most common type of phishing attack happens through email, in which typically there is a malicious link enclosed. Let's look at the example below.</p>

    <p>Here, an email has been received from LinkedIn notifying a user of a new job offer, and they should log in to review it. The email might seem as if it originated from LinkedIn at first glance but if we look closely, it can be seen that there is a spelling error in both the link attached and the email address from which it originated.</p>
    <p>Let’s explore what happens when the attached link is clicked.</p>

    <p>This is an example of a simple, yet effective, method of harvesting credentials. While many individuals might not fall for this method, this email can be sent to hundreds of people and the attacker only needs one victim for success.</p>

    <h4 class="p-4">How is Phishing Carried Out?</h4>

    <p>Below mentioned are some various ways through which individuals fall prey to phishing attacks.

    <ul>
        <li>Clicking on an unknown file or attachment: Here, the attacker sends a mysterious file to the victim, when the victim opens the file, malware may be installed on their system, or it prompts the user to enter confidential information.</li>
        <li>Using an open or free Wi-Fi hotspot: This is a simple way to get confidential information from a target. In this scenario, the owner of the Wi-Fi can control and see the target's data without them knowing.</li>
        <li>Responding to social media requests: This is generally used in social engineering and open source intelligence gathering, where the victim unknowingly provides the attacker with information that can be used to exploit them.</li>
        <li>Clicking on unauthenticated links or ads: Links can be crafted to lead to a malicious website to trick the victim into entering confidential information, as seen in our example.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="p-4">Types of Phishing Attacks</h4>

    <p>There are various categories of phishing attacks used by attackers. Outlined below are some of the most frequently seen and used.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Email Phishing: Email phishing is a cyberattack technique where malicious actors send fraudulent emails designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or installing malware. These emails often appear to come from trusted sources like banks or companies, using official-looking logos and email addresses. They create a sense of urgency or fear, urging victims to act quickly, such as clicking a link to verify an account or downloading an attachment. Phishing emails often contain suspicious links that lead to fake websites mimicking legitimate ones, aiming to harvest credentials or other personal data.</li>
        <li>Spear Phishing: Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack that focuses on specific individuals or organizations, using personalized information to increase the likelihood of success. Unlike general phishing, which casts a wide net, spear phishing emails often reference personal details like the recipient’s name, job title, or recent activities to appear legitimate and trustworthy. The attacker may impersonate a trusted contact, such as a colleague or boss, and craft messages that align with the recipient's context or responsibilities, such as requesting sensitive data, login credentials, or financial transactions. These highly tailored attacks require vigilance.</li>
        <li>Whaling: Whaling is just like spear-phishing, but the main target is the head of the company, like the CEO. A pressurized email is sent to such executives so that they don’t have much time to think, therefore falling prey to phishing.</li>
        <li>Smishing: This is a form of cyberattack where malicious actors use text messages (SMS) to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information, clicking on malicious links, or downloading malware. Smishing messages often appear to come from trusted entities and typically create a sense of urgency, such as claiming there’s an issue with an account or a missed package delivery.</li>
        <li>Vishing: In this method, the attacker calls the victim using modern caller ID spoofing to convince the victim that the call is from a trusted source. Attackers also use IVR to steal credit card numbers or confidential data from the victim.</li>
        <li>Clone Phishing: Clone Phishing this type of phishing attack, the attacker copies the email messages that were sent from a trusted source and then alters the information by adding a link that redirects the victim to a malicious or fake website. Now the attacker sends this mail to a larger number of users and then waits to watch who clicks on the attachment that was sent in the email. It spreads through the contacts of the user who has clicked on the attachment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="p-4">Impact of Phishing</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Financial Loss</li>
        <p>Victims of phishing may experience immediate financial harm through unauthorized transactions, such as money transfers, fraudulent purchases, or theft from bank accounts. Indirectly, identity theft resulting from phishing can lead to long-term financial damage, including fraudulent loans, credit card misuse, or the cost of resolving compromised accounts. For businesses, the financial toll can also include paying ransoms, fines, or investing heavily in remediation efforts after an attack.</p>
        <li>Data Breaches</li>
        <p>Phishing attacks often target employees or individuals to gain access to sensitive data, such as customer records, intellectual property, or confidential internal communications. This can lead to large-scale data breaches, exposing organizations to competitive risks, legal liabilities, and regulatory scrutiny. The stolen data may also be sold on the dark web, amplifying the risk of further misuse by other malicious actors.</p>
        <li>Reputation Damage</li>
        <p>Phishing attacks can severely damage the reputation of individuals and organizations. A company that suffers a breach due to phishing may lose customer trust, face negative publicity, and struggle to rebuild its credibility in the market. Similarly, individuals who fall victim to phishing may face embarrassment or skepticism when dealing with future transactions or interactions.</p>
        <li>Operational Disruption</li>
        <p>Phishing can disrupt normal business operations by infecting systems with malware, locking down critical files through ransomware, or misdirecting employee efforts to deal with the aftermath. Recovery processes, including forensic investigations, system restoration, and customer communication, can consume significant time and resources, reducing productivity and delaying projects.</p>
        <li>Legal and Regulatory Penalties</li>
        <p>Organizations are legally responsible for protecting sensitive data, and failure to do so can result in fines and penalties under regulations like the GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA. Additionally, victims of data breaches may file lawsuits against the organization for negligence, compounding the financial and reputational damage. Regulatory investigations following a phishing incident can further strain organizational resources and lead to long-term oversight.</p>
    </ol>

    <h4 class="p-4">How To Stay Protected Against Phishing?</h4>

    <p>Up to now we have seen how phishing attacks are carried out as well as the negative impacts' phishing can have on individuals and organisations. Below are some best practices which can be used to mitigate the threat of phishing.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Trusted Sources: Download software from trusted and verified sources only.</li>
        <li>Confidentiality: Never share private information with unknown individuals or entities. Be sure to verify the source of the request, especially when feeling pressured.</li>
        <li>Verify URLs: Be sure to examine URLs before using them, go right to the source where possible instead of using a link.</li>
        <li>Phishing Detection: Use phishing-detection tools to monitor for maliciously crafted websites.
        <li>Avoid free Wi-Fi: Avoid public Wi-Fi and ensure a VPN is in use.</li>
        <li>Email Filtering: Enable spam filters and email security tools that can identify and block phishing emails before they reach your inbox.</li>
        <li>Antivirus Software: Install and regularly update antivirus software to detect and block malicious payloads.</li>
        <li>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Protect accounts with an additional layer of security that requires multiple forms of verification.</li>
        <li>Limit Sharing: Be mindful of the information you share online, especially on social media, as attackers can use it for phishing schemes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="p-4">Anti-Phishing Tools</h4>

    <p>It’s essential to use Anti-Phishing tools to detect phishing attacks. Here are some of the most popular and effective anti-phishing tools available:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Anti-Phishing Domain Advisor (APDA): A browser extension that warns users when they visit a phishing website. It uses a database of known phishing sites and provides real-time protection against new threats.</li>
        <li>PhishTank: A community-driven website that collects and verifies reports of phishing attacks. Users can submit phishing reports and check the status of suspicious websites.</li>
        <li>Malwarebytes Anti-Phishing: A security tool that protects against phishing attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious websites. It uses a combination of machine learning and signature-based detection to provide real-time protection.</li>
